                                    The Buzz Car was a group project to develop a line following car kit
                                    for the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Design Fundamentals course.
                                    Given a fictional scenario, third-year undergraduate ECE students played the role of
                                    engineers hired by a toy company entrepreneur in groups of four, utilizing both
                                    hardware and software to solve the problem. The final deliverable was a prototype
                                    educational kit for K-12 classrooms that could be further developed into a
                                    marketable product to be sold.

                                    A list of customer requirements were as follows:

                                    The Buzz Car was Formula-1 themed to appeal to the target audience and the entire
                                    system was split into four different systems:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Motion subsystem: Controls the movement of the car using a PID closed feedback
                                        loop</li>
                                    <li>Sensing subsystem: Receives and processes the sensor data</li>
                                    <li>Output subsystem: Transmits data about the car through visual and audio</li>
                                    <li>Hardware subsystem: Sends power to the rest of the subsystems from the power
                                        source + the outer shell</li>
                                    <li>Controller "subsystem" (pseudo-subsystem): The central ESP32 microcontroller
                                        communicating with and connecting data flow between the other subsystems</li>
                                </ol>
                                Each of the four group members was assigned to a subsystem that they would primarily
                                work on. The subsystems interacted with each other through input and output to and from
                                the subsystems.
                                <br> PCBs were designed for each subsystem (including the controller "subsystem") to
                                ensure the entire system was modular.

                            <p>
                                As the team leader, there was responsibility to ensure the team stayed on track with a
                                weekly schedule that was created at the beginning of the semester then gradually updated
                                as needed. Weekly notes, group todo lists, and other documentation was tracked in a lab
                                notebook in Microsoft OneNote.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Output Subsystem</h3>
                            <p>
                                The output subsystem was assigned, which mainly consists of a speaker and an LCD screen.
                                Thus, the two components were designed for (breadboarding, schematic, PCB design) and
                                tested separately. The output subsystem was separate from the main function of the car
                                to follow a line so a balance was kept between power usage and usability of
                                each main component. This led to the 16x2 LCD and PCB mount speaker to be chosen. The
                                LCD took more power but was larger than other screens that used less power, leading to
                                readability of the text. Because of this, a speaker that used less power was chosen even
                                if it meant limiting the audio functionality to a series of single tones.
                                <br> The total components used in this subsystem are shown below:

                            <p>
                                The screen acted as a visual indicator of whether the four sensors on the car detected
                                white or black, as well as whether the car is going straight, turning right, or turning
                                left.
                            </p>

                            <h4>Speaker Function</h4>
                            <p>
                                The speaker played a series of singular tones at different frequencies and durations
                                using the Arduino <a
                                    href="https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/advanced-io/tone/"
                                    target="_blank">tone() function</a>. While it is possible to simply write a series
                                of tone(), delay(), and noTone() functions to write a sequence of notes, MIDI files
                                could also be converted into a series of these functions easily using a website by
                                @TawsifTorabi, which can be checked out <a
                                    href="https://tawsiftorabi.github.io/Midi2ArduinoTone/" target="_blank">here</a>.
                                <br><br> The user would have the ability to change what is being played while the car is
                                moving and performing its line-following function. In the demonstration of the
                                prototype, the audio being played was the Georgia "Ramblin Wreck" Fight Song which was
                                converted from an mp4 from the official <a href="https://swag.gatech.edu/node/245"
                                    target="_blank">Georgia Tech Music Downloads page</a> to a MIDI file, then to a
                                series of tone() functions using the tool mentioned earlier.

                                        The LCD screen was breadboarded and initially tested with the ESP32. The
                                        LiquidCrystal library was used in the Arduino IDE. The test code printed "Hello
                                        world" on the first row and the number of seconds that had passed since setup on

                                    The speaker was also breadboarded and tested for functionality, but with an Arduino
                                    rather than an ESP32. The tone() function was used to play three frequency tunes
                                    in a loop repeatedly, just to check for speaker function.

                                PCBs for the LCD and speaker were created to be small to fit on the car, utilizing vias
                                for the GND connections. The PCBs were then fabricated through JLCPCB.

                                    <p>There were two different iterations of the LCD schematic and PCB design. One
                                        utilizes levelshifters which were meant to ensure a consistent 5V since it was
                                        unclear before fabrication if the ESP32 could provide consistent enough power.
                                        This ended up being unnecessary, but the design was fabricated just in case.
                                        Both iterations can be seen in the slideshow.

                            The PCBs were then integrated with the rest of the system.

                                The LCD PCB was connected after the sensing and motion subsystems were deemed to
                                function together well, which means that the sensing values were influencing whether the
                                car was turning or going straight. The LCD being added was to show this information to
                                the user. After the LCD was displayig the correct values and the car was turnng as
                                needed based on sensor values, then the speaker was added.
                                <br><br> The speaker code was meant to run the entire time the car was in motion, so
                                threads were used, where one thread was for the speaker and the other thread was for the
                                sensing and motion code. This code worked successfully to allow the car to run while the
                                audio was also playing.
