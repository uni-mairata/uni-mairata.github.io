                                    The Buzz Car was a group project to develop a line following car kit
                                    for the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Design Fundamentals course.
                                    Given a fictional scenario, third-year undergraduate ECE students played the role of
                                    engineers hired by a toy company entrepreneur in groups of four, utilizing both
                                    hardware and software to solve the problem. The final deliverable was a prototype
                                    educational kit for K-12 classrooms that could be further developed into a
                                    marketable product to be sold.
                                </p>

                                    A list of customer requirements were as follows:

                                    The Buzz Car was Formula-1 themed to appeal to the target audience and the entire
                                    system was split into four different systems:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Motion subsystem: Controls the movement of the car using a PID closed feedback
                                        loop</li>
                                    <li>Sensing subsystem: Receives and processes the sensor data</li>
                                    <li>Output subsystem: Transmits data about the car through visual and audio</li>
                                    <li>Hardware subsystem: Sends power to the rest of the subsystems from the power
                                        source + the outer shell</li>
                                    <li>Controller "subsystem" (pseudo-subsystem): The central ESP32 microcontroller
                                        communicating with and connecting data flow between the other subsystems</li>
                                </ol>
                                Each of the four group members was assigned to a subsystem that they would primarily
                                work on. The subsystems interacted with each other through input and output to and from
                                the subsystems.
                                <br> PCBs were designed for each subsystem (including the controller "subsystem") to
                                ensure the entire system was modular.

                            <h3>Leadership and Thorough Documentation</h3>
                            <p>
                                As the team leader, there was responsibility to ensure the team stayed on track with a
                                weekly schedule that was created at the beginning of the semester then gradually updated
                                as needed. Weekly notes, group todo lists, and other documentation was tracked in a lab
                                notebook in Microsoft OneNote.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Output Subsystem</h3>
                            <p>
                                The output subsystem was assigned, which mainly consists of a speaker and an LCD screen.
                                Thus, the two components were designed for (breadboarding, schematic, PCB design) and
                                tested separately. The output subsystem was separate from the main function of the car
                                to follow a line so a balance was kept between power usage and usability of
                                each main component. This led to the 16x2 LCD and PCB mount speaker to be chosen. The
                                LCD took more power but was larger than other screens that used less power, leading to
                                readability of the text. Because of this, a speaker that used less power was chosen even
                                if it meant limiting the audio functionality to a series of single tones.
                                <br> The total components used in this subsystem are shown below:

                                The screen acted as a visual indicator of whether the four sensors on the car detected
                                white or black, as well as whether the car is going straight, turning right, or turning
                                left.

                                        The LCD screen was breadboarded and initially tested with the ESP32. The
                                        LiquidCrystal library was used in the Arduino IDE. The test code printed "Hello
                                        world" on the first row and the number of seconds that had passed since setup on
                                        the second row.

                                The speaker played a series of singular tones at different frequencies and durations
                                using the Arduino <a
                                    href="https://docs.arduino.cc/language-reference/en/functions/advanced-io/tone/"
                                    target="_blank">tone() function</a>. While it is possible to simply write a series
                                of tone(), delay(), and noTone() functions to write a sequence of notes, MIDI files
                                could also be converted into a series of these functions easily using a website by
                                @TawsifTorabi, which can be checked out <a
                                    href="https://tawsiftorabi.github.io/Midi2ArduinoTone/" target="_blank">here</a>.

                                moving and performing its line-following function. In the demonstration of the
                                prototype, the audio being played was the Georgia "Ramblin Wreck" Fight Song which was
                                converted from an mp4 from the official <a href="https://swag.gatech.edu/node/245"
                                    target="_blank">Georgia Tech Music Downloads page</a> to a MIDI file, then to a
                                series of tone() functions using the tool mentioned earlier.
